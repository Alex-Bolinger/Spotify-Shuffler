<h1>Spotify Shuffler</h1>
Spotify Shuffler is a web app integration of the Spotify API used to take in user playlists and add a shuffled version of that playlist to their account.

This app was created after noticing several different bugs revolving around Spotify's shuffling algorithm. Rather than wait for Spotify devs to fix the problem, I took it upon myself to solve the problem for myself by avoiding the feature entirely.

<h3>How to use:</h3>
<ol>
<li> Open in Spotify the playlist you want to shuffle.</li>
<li> Click on share and copy a link to the playlist.</li>
<li> Go to https://spotify-shuffler.uc.r.appspot.com/login and login to your Spotify account.</li>
<li> In the text box, paste the link to the playlist and click submit.</li>
<li> If you go back to Spotify and view your playlists, you should find a new playlist with the same name as the previous one with "- SHUFFLED" added on the end.</li>
<li> Turn of shuffle and enjoy :)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Future Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Proper homepage</li>
<li>Styling with react</li>
<li>Optionally replace playlists rather than adding new ones</li>
<li>Mobile app</li>
<li>Playback control</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
This app is still under development and thus has a restricted user count that can access the Spotify API calls this app uses. Because of this, access to this app must be granted individually by an admin.
